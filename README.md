*** SYSC3110 Monopoly Project Milestone 1 README ***

Project Authors: Connor Marcus, Noah Hammoud, George Pantazopoulos and Vahid Foroughi.
------------------------------------
Project Deliverables:
The Milestone 1 Monopoly project consists of an executable jar file with the source code, a documentation file, and UML class and sequence diagrams. The source code consists of 8 classes: CommandList, Dice, Game, MonopolyBoard, Player, Property, PropertyFreeSpace, and PropertyStreet. The documentation file contains a description of the classes, an explanation of the design decisions, and a user manual. Lastly, the UML class and sequence diagrams provide a model of the problem domain and relevant runtime scenarios. 
------------------------------------
Steps to run the project executable:
1. Download the project zip file.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the extracted zip file using the command line.
4. Execute the jar file on the command line (e.g.: java -jar SYSC3110Project.jar).
Note 1: The steps assume that Java is already installed on the system and that the system can run jar files on the command line.
Note 2: More details about how to play the game can be found in the user manual.
------------------------------------
Roadmap Ahead:
The next step in the project is to make a GUI-based version of the game using the swing library.
